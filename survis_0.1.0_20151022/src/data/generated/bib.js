        "abstract": "\"The efficiency of Public Transportation (PT) Networks is a major goal of any urban area authority. Advances on both location and communication devices drastically increased the availability of the data generated by their operations. Adequate Machine Learning methods can thus be applied to identify patterns useful to improve the Schedule Plan. In this paper, the authors propose a fully automated learning framework to determine the best Schedule Coverage to be assigned to a given PT network based on Automatic Vehicle location (AVL) and Automatic Passenger Counting (APC) data. We formulate this problem as a clustering one, where the best number of clusters is selected through an ad-hoc metric. This metric takes into account multiple domain constraints, computed using Sequence Mining and Probabilistic Reasoning. A case study from a large operator in Sweden was selected to validate our methodology. Experimental results suggest necessary changes on the Schedule coverage. Moreover, an impact study was conducted through a large-scale simulation over the affected time period. Its results uncovered potential improvements of the schedule reliability on a large scale.\",",

        "abstract": "\"The accurate passenger flow prediction is the base of bus scheduling and bus dispatching. Many factors, including internal factors and external factors, have great impact on the fluctuation of passenger flow. In the modern informationized bus system, many influencing factors became available by multi-source data. Current passenger flow prediction methods are mainly based on statistical predicting methods and machine learning methods. The implication of interpolating prediction method on passenger flow prediction is preliminary. Interpolating prediction method makes use of historical data; the prediction result is generally accurate, and the method is robust. Interpolating prediction method shows good performance and has mature application in other research areas. This paper makes use of historical passenger data and multi-source data; apply Shepard model to predict public transportation passenger flow. The result shows that Shepard prediction model has better performance than that of neural network (NN) model and support vector machine (SVM) model. The mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) has increased 7.5 and 3.43{\\%}; the MSP has increased 16 and 10.51{\\%} compared with NN and SVM and has lower dependency of parameters.\",",

        "abstract": "Intelligent transportation systems based on automated data collection frameworks are widely used by the major transit companies around the globe. This paper describes the current state of the art on improving both planning and control on public road transportation companies using automatic vehicle location (AVL) data. By surveying this topic, the expectation is to help develop a better understanding of the nature, approaches, challenges, and opportunities with regard to these problems. This paper starts by presenting a brief review on improving the network definition based on historical location-based data. Second, it presents a comprehensive review on AVL-based evaluation techniques of the schedule plan (SP) reliability, discussing the existing metrics. Then, the different dimensions on improving the SP reliability are presented in detail, as well as the works addressing such problem. Finally, the automatic control strategies are also revised, along with the research employed over the location-based data. A comprehensive discussion on the techniques employed is provided to encourage those who are starting research on this topic. It is important to highlight that there are still gaps in AVL-based literature, such as the following: 1) long-term travel time prediction; 2) finding optimal slack time; or 3) choosing the best control strategy to apply in each situation in the event of schedule instability. Hence, this paper includes introductory model formulations, reference surveys, formal definitions, and an overview of a promising area, which is of interest to any researcher, regardless of the level of expertise.",

        "abstract": "In this paper we present the passenger demand prediction model of BusGrid. BusGrid is a novel information system for the improvement of productivity and customer service in public transport bus services. BusGrid receives and processes real time data from the automated vehicle location (AVL) and the automated passenger counting (APC) sensors installed on a bus fleet and assists their operator on the improvement of bus schedules and the design of new bus routes and stops based on the expected demand. For the prediction of passenger demand in any bus stop, the raw sensor data were pre-processed and several different feature sets were extracted and tested as predictors of passenger demand. The pre-processed data were used for the supervised learning of a regression model that predicts people demand for any given bus stop and route. Experimental results show that the proposed approach achieved significant improvements over the baseline approaches. Knowledge representation, through the proposed feature set, played a key role on the ability of the prediction model to generalize well beyond its training set, to new bus stops and routes.",

        "abstract": "Bibiographic data such as collections of scientific articles and citation networks have been studied extensively in information visualization and visual analytics research. Powerful systems have been built to support various types of bibliographic analysis, but they require some training and cannot be used to disseminate the insights gained. In contrast, we focused on developing a more accessible visual analytics system, called SurVis, that is ready to disseminate a carefully surveyed literature collection. The authors of a survey may use our Web-based system to structure and analyze their literature database. Later, readers of the survey can obtain an overview, quickly retrieve specific publications, and reproduce or extend the original bibliographic analysis. Our system employs a set of selectors that enable users to filter and browse the literature collection as well as to control interactive visualizations. The versatile selector concept includes selectors for textual search, filtering by keywords and meta-information, selection and clustering of similar publications, and following citation links. Agreement to the selector is represented by word-sized sparkline visualizations seamlessly integrated into the user interface. Based on an analysis of the analytical reasoning process, we derived requirements for the system. We developed the system in a formative way involving other researchers writing literature surveys. A questionnaire study with 14 visual analytics experts confirms that SurVis meets the initially formulated requirements.",

        "abstract": "Smart card transactions are known as a rich and continuous source of public transit data, but they miss some important attributes about trips and passengers. One of these missing attributes is the trip purpose attribute. This paper proposes a novel method to infer the trip purpose attribute from the sequences of trips of passengers instead of separate trips. The proposed method infers the trip purpose attribute (a missing attribute in the smart card data) from the temporal attributes (available attributes in the smart card data). First, the relation between the temporal attributes and the trip purpose attribute is learnt by discovering clusters of passengers in the Household Travel Survey dataset while each passenger is represented by one sequence of trips. Then, the discovered clusters are utilized to infer the trip purpose of smart card transactions by allocating each passenger to the closest clusters. The proposed method is implemented on the smart card and HTS datasets from southeast Queensland, Australia. The evaluation results showed a considerable improvement in inferring the trip purpose compared to the results published in the literature. Notably, the effect of considering the trip sequence was more significant than considering land use variables.",

        "abstract": "Nowadays, every public transportation company uses Automatic Vehicle Location (AVL) systems to track the services provided by each vehicle. Such information can be used to improve operational planning. This paper describes an AVL-based evaluation framework to test whether the actual Schedule Plan fits, in terms of days covered by each schedule, the network\u2019s operational conditions. Firstly, clustering is employed to group days with similar profiles in terms of travel times (this is done for each different route). Secondly, consensus clustering is used to obtain a unique set of clusters for all routes. Finally, a set of rules about the groups content is drawn based on appropriate decision variables. Each group will correspond to a different schedule and the rules identify the days covered by each schedule. This methodology is simultaneously an evaluator of the schedules that are offered by the company (regarding its coverage) and an advisor on possible changes to such offer. It was tested by using data collected for one year in a company running in Porto, Portugal. The results are sound. The main contribution of this paper is that it proposes a way to combine Machine Learning techniques to add a novel dimension to the Schedule Plan evaluation methods: the day coverage. Such approach meets no parallel in the current literature.",

        "abstract": "This paper is about long-term travel time prediction in public transportation. However, it can be useful for a wider area of applications. It follows a heterogeneous ensemble approach with dynamic selection. A vast set of experiments with a pool of 128 tuples of algorithms and parameter sets (a&ps) has been conducted for each of the six studied routes. Three different algorithms, namely, random forest, projection pursuit regression and support vector machines, were used. Then, ensembles of different sizes were obtained after a pruning step. The best approach to combine the outputs is also addressed. Finally, the best ensemble approach for each of the six routes is compared with the best individual a&ps. The results confirm that heterogeneous ensembles are adequate for long-term travel time prediction. Namely, they achieve both higher accuracy and robustness along time than state-of-the-art learners.",

        "abstract": "Public transport users are increasingly expecting better service and up to date information, in pursuit of a seamless journey experience. In order to meet these expectations, many transport operators are already offering free mobile apps to help customers better plan their journeys and access real-time travel information. Leveraging the spatio-temporal data that such apps can produce at scale (i.e. timestamped GPS traces), opens an opportunity to bridge the gap between passenger expectations and capabilities of the operators by providing a real-time 360-degree view of the transport network based on the \u2018Apps as infrastructure\u2019 paradigm. The first step towards fulfilling this vision is to understand which routes and services the passengers are travelling on at any given time. Mapping a GPS trace onto a particular transport network is known as \u2018network matching\u2019. In this paper, the problem is formulated as a supervised sequence classification task, where sequences are made of geographic coordinates, time, and line and direction of travel as the label. We present and compare two data-driven approaches to this problem: (i) a heuristic algorithm, which looks for nearby stops and makes an estimation based on their timetables \u2014 used as a baseline \u2014 and (ii) a deep learning approach using a recurrent neural network (RNN). Since RNNs require considerable amounts of data to train a good model, and collecting and labelling this data from real users is a challenging task, one of our contributions is a synthetic journey data generator. The datasets that we generated have been made as realistic as possible by querying real timetables and adding position and temporal noise to simulate variable GPS accuracy and vehicle delays, sampled from empirical distributions estimated using thousands of real location reports. To validate our approach we have used a separate dataset made of hundreds of real user journeys provided by a UK-based bus operator. Our experimental results are very promising and our next step is to deploy the solution in a production environment. From the operator\u2019s point of view, this will enable multiple smart applications like account-based ticketing, identification of disruptions, real-time passenger counting, and network analysis.",
